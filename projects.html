      <h1>CS451: Numerical Computation</h1>
      <p>I attended this course during my Fall 2022 course, and we did multiple programs involving numercial
        analysis like B-spline and La Grange Form.
      </p>
      <p>Note: Most of my projects for this course was done through Repl. I would fork the projects then use the shell tab rather than the console tab.</p>
      <p>Run this command: "gcc {the c file} -lm -lX11", after that do "./a.out"</p>
      <p>Additional Information: To see the final result you would need to click on the black box on the right.
      </p>
      <h2><a href = "https://replit.com/@KevinVuong1/La-Grange-Form">La Grange</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented the Legrange polynomial form where the user will click as many dots from right to left.
        </li>
      </ul> 
      <h2><a href = "https://replit.com/@KevinVuong1/NaturalSpline">Natural Spline</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented the Natural Spline where the user will click as many dots (with the minimum of 3 dots) from right to left.
          Then, it will trace out the Natural Spline.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href = "https://replit.com/@KevinVuong1/BSplineHW">B-Spline</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented the B-Spline form where the user can click at the minimum of 3 dots anywhere in the white screen.
          Then, it will trace out the B-Spline Curves.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a href = "https://replit.com/@KevinVuong1/Newtons-Form#Newtons.c">Newtons Form</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For this project, it will use the Newton's Method. The user will need to click at the minimum of 3 dots from right to left.
          At the end, my program will trace as many cubic functions then the leftover dots will be traced with quadratic functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition, it will calculate the integral/area for the cubic and quadratic.
        </li>
