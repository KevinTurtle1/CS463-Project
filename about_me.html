    <p class="profile_text">
      I'm a fourth-year student at Portland State University pursuing a
      Bachelor's Degree in computer science with a focus on software development
      and web development. However, I'm open to learning new and different
      aspects of computer science. My current programming experience includes
      C++, C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and HTML. I worked for Siemens
      Electronic Design Automation for six months as a MECOP Intern, and I'm
      soon to be working for Cambia Health Solutions as a MECOP Software
      Development Engineering Intern in April. I also have four years of
      experience as a lifeguard and swim instructor.
